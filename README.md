# Borwell Software Challenge

## The Challenge
Write a program that takes as input the dimensions of a room and outputs the following:
* Area of the floor
* Amount of paint required to paint the walls
* Volume of the room

## Solution Version 1.0 - *Basic Rectangular Room*
This solution takes as input the *width*, *depth* and *height* of a room, and calculates the required output.

## Solution Version 2.0 - *Basic Rectangular Room with Windows/Doors*
This solution takes *width*, *depth* and *height* as input, as in version 1.0, but this time also allows the user to enter multiple windows/doors/areas not to be painted, by entering a list of *widths* and *heights* to be left paint-free.

## Solution Version 3.0 - *Custom Shape Room with Windows/Doors*
This solution gives the user the option of entering *width*, *depth* and *height* as before, or allowing the user to specify a more complex polygonal shape, by entering a list of *coordinates* which make up the shape of the room, from which the required output is calculated, including the option to add windows/doors as in version 2.0.
